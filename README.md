# sql-challenge


This is my SQL-challenge it consists of all the CSV files required to create tables and run queries (departments, employees, dept_emp, dept_manager, salaries, titles),
three SQL files: table creation, queries and Quick DBD-export of the ERD created, a Quick DBD-export PNG file of the ERD created and finally the code to create the ERD in a txt file. All files are stored in their allocated folders.




Note; I had issues with using DATE in birth_date and hire_date when creating tabkes so instead i used VARCHAR, I do apologise but I did ask for quite a bit of help but nothing succeeded and I ran out of time. Also, I did receive help from learning assistants and a tutor to hep cealn my code when creating tables.
